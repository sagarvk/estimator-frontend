            EstimatorPro Consultants believes in helping its customers as far as
            possible, and has therefore a liberal cancellation policy. Under
            this policy:.
          </p>{" "}
          <p>
            &#8226; Cancellations will be considered only if the request is made
            immediately after placing the order. However, the cancellation
            request may not be entertained if the orders have been communicated
            to the vendors/merchants and they have initiated the process of
            shipping them.
          </p>
          <p>
            &#8226; EstimatorPro Consultants does not accept cancellation
            requests for perishable items like flowers, eatables etc. However,
            refund/replacement can be made if the customer establishes that the
            quality of product delivered is not good.
